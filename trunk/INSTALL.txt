Try:

  python setup.py install


== Depending packages ==

* NetworkX 
* scipy
* graphviz
* pygraphviz
* pyparsing
* python-gnuplot

=== scipy ===

scipy is a big beast. It depends on LAPACK, an even bigger beast. So
it might be hard to install. If it doesn't install from your distro it
could be worth it to to try the bleeding edge from subversion.


=== easy_install === 

Since you will need a whole lot of other stuff. It is suggested to
install easy_install. Try:

  wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py && sudo python ez_setup.py

  for $p in networkx pygraphviz pyparsing numpy ipython; do easy_install $p; done


=== Importing dot files ===

In case you have troubles installing graphviz, try:

  easy_install pyparsing

====pydot====
pydot is very slow, and you should not use it for big datasets.

pydot (http://dkbza.org/pydot.html) is quite active, so maybe it's
good to use the most current version for now.  It's licensed under the
MIT license.

  svn checkout http://pydot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pydot
  cd pydot
  sudo python setup.py install


== Debianic ==

=== stable ===

This might be enough:

  apt-get install ipython python-scipy python-pygraphviz python-pyparsing python-networkx python-pydot

=== Ubuntu Dapper ===

Uncomment universe stuff in /etc/apt/sources.list
  
  apt-get install ipython python-scipy python-pyparsing python-f2py g77
  easy_install networkx
  # now do the pydot thing
  easy_install numpy
