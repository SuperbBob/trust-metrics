Try:

  python setup.py install


== Depending packages ==

* python-setuptools
* NetworkX <= 0.37
* scipy
* graphviz
* pygraphviz >= 0.37 (need [graphviz-dev|graphviz-devel] ) | pydot (it is better to install pygraphviz, because pydot has some bug..)
* pyparsing
* python-gnuplot (not required from r716)
* python-bz2 (might included in Python) | bzip2
* pynetconv (included in svn repo, or in relase >= 0.1 )

=== scipy ===

scipy is a big beast. It depends on LAPACK, an even bigger beast. So
it might be hard to install. If it doesn't install from your distro it
could be worth it to to try the bleeding edge from subversion.


=== easy_install === 

Since you will need a whole lot of other stuff. It is suggested to
install easy_install. Try:

  wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py && sudo python ez_setup.py

  for $p in networkx pygraphviz pyparsing numpy ipython; do easy_install $p; done


=== Importing dot files ===

In case you have troubles installing graphviz, try:

  easy_install pyparsing

====pydot====
pydot is very slow, and you should not use it for big datasets.

pydot (http://dkbza.org/pydot.html) is quite active, so maybe it's
good to use the most current version for now.  It's licensed under the
MIT license.

  svn checkout http://pydot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pydot
  cd pydot
  sudo python setup.py install


== Debianic ==

=== stable ===

This might be enough:

  apt-get install ipython python-scipy python-pygraphviz python-pyparsing python-networkx python-pydot

=== Ubuntu Dapper ===

Uncomment universe stuff in /etc/apt/sources.list
  
  apt-get install ipython python-scipy python-pyparsing python-f2py g77
  easy_install networkx
  # now do the pydot thing
  easy_install numpy

== Script install == 

If you want to install script utilities in you /usr/bin directory,
you must enter in 'scripts', and in 'trustlet' folder and type only 'make'.

If you type make in scripts folder will be installed those script:

wikixml2graph
sync_trustlet
syncrm_trustlet
lsc2
dot2c2

if you type make in trustlet folder will be installed this script:

netevolution
