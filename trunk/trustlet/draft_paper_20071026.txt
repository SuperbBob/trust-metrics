== Abstract ==

In this paper we propose a comparison of different trust metrics previously proposed in literature on the real world dataset of Advogato, a community of free software developers.  and its peculiar characteristics is trust statements/relationships are weighted.

== Introduction ==

we ...

intro about how it is common to interact with unknown people/entities and how it is important to have tools for getting an (initial) idea of the trustworthiness of the other party.... trust metrics / reputation systems

In motivation cite Artificial Intelligence Review (2005) Review on Computational Trust and Reputation Models JORDI SABATER & CARLES SIERRA: ''Finally, analyzing the models presented in this article we found that there is a complete absence of test-beds and frameworks to evaluate and compare the models under a set of representative and common
conditions. This situation is quite confusing, specially for the possible users of these trust and reputation models. It is thus urgent to define a set of test-beds that allow the research community to establish comparisons in a similar way to what happens in other areas (e.g. machine learning (UCI 2003)).''

Mention there is ART Testbed, cite "A Design Foundation for a Trust-Modeling Experimental Testbed" but say how this is different: it is more about strategies for interactions in societies, in which there is competition.

== Advogato social network ==

Advogato <ref>http://advogato.org</ref> is an online community site dedicated to free software development. It was created by [[Raph Levien]], who also used Advogato as a research testbed for testing his own attack-resistant trust metric, the [[Advogato trust metric]]. On Advogato users can certify each other on three different levels: Apprentice, Journeyer, and Master and the Advogato trust metric uses this information in order to assign a certification level to every user. The goal is to be [[Attack resistance|attack-resistant]], i.e. to reduce the impact of attackers.

From Levien thesis    '' The Advogato website launched in November 1999, and has been in continuous operation since. It serves as a community message board for free software developers. The heart of Advogato is the certification mechanism, essentially a straightforward implementation of the group trust metric.''


An interesting characteristic of the Advogato dataset is that is it weighted: directed edges between nodes are specified on a 4 levels base, Observer, Apprentice, Journeyer, and Master. 
According to Advogato <ref>http://advogato.org/certs.html</ref>,  ''All of these levels are based on free software only, as defined by the Debian Free Software Guidelines. In general, you should base the level on work done in the last year.'' (this is the trust context). The semantics encouraged by Advogato site is the following:

A '''Master''' is the principal author or hard-working co-author of an "important" free software project, i.e. one that many people depend on, or one that stands out in quality. A Master has command of the tools and is an excellent programmer. Generally, a Master works equivalent to full time (or more) on free software. Ideally, a Master writes clearly about the work and its broader context, and serves as a mentor to others in the free software community.

'''Journeyers''' are the people who make free software happen. A journeyer contributes significantly to an important free software project, or is the author of a useful or technically innovative project. A Journeyer is generally a competent programmer, but significant contributions of documentation, artwork, or other non-code goodies counts too. Ideally, a Journeyer works with others in the free software community to polish and refine the library of free software. While not necessarily the equivalent of full time, a Journeyer spends a significant amount of time on free software.

An '''apprentice''' is someone who has contributed in some way to a free software project, but is still striving to acquire the skills and standing in the community to make more significant contributions. Ideally, the Apprentice is in touch with either an individual mentor or a community that helps to gain these skills. An Apprentice spends a significant amount of time learning the craft of software development, whether by hands-on practice, academic study, or careful observation.

A user with no trust certification is referred to as an '''observer.''' This is the default trust level of a new user and the level to which you would certify someone to remove an existing trust certification. An observer does not have posting privileges and other powers associated with trust users. They have read-only access to Advogato, with the exceptions of editing their own user profile and posting blog entries". 

However it might be argued that not necessarily all the users checked, were aware of and followed the suggested semantics.

For the purpose of this paper we consider these certifications as trust statements. T(A,B) donotes the certification (trust statement) expressed by user A about user B and we map the textual labels Observer, Apprentice, Journeyer and Master in the range [0,1], respectively in the values 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. This choice is somehow arbitrary but it considers the fact all the certifications are in fact positive judgments but "observer" is often used for expressing less-than-sufficient levels. {{todo|bla!find better motivation!}} For example we model the fact raph certified federico as Journeyer as T(raph,federico)=0.8.

There are other web communities using the same software powering Advogato.org and they have the same social structure: same trust levels and certifications system. These communities are [[robots.net]], persone.softwarelibero.org, people.squeakfoundation.org, kaitiaki.org.nz. The software publishes the entire trust graph as a graph.dot file in the dot format.

== Trust metrics ==
A trust metric is a technique for predicting how much a certain user can be trusted by the other users of the community <ref>add references</ref>.

The basic assumption of trust metrics is that trust can be propagated in some way. The reason is that you trust your friend more than a stranger and so, under certain conditions, a friend of your friend is possibly more trustworthy than a random stranger (at least because your friend trusts her).

For example, in the context of cinema if all your 10 trusted cinema friends trust "Mary" (that you don't know) about her taste in movies, a trust metric might predict that you will find her opinions about movies useful as well and so that you should trust her.

In decentralized environments, in which there are many autonomous entities (users, robots, servers, peers, ...) and it is quite common to interact with unknown entities, it is important to have some tools for making informed guesses about the trustworthiness of these other entities. Trust metrics have been in fact applied to domain as different as social web sites, p2p systems, recommender systems, mobile computing, public key cryptography ... 

Trust metrics can either be local or global, depending on the fact they compute personalized values of trust or not<ref name=Massa2007 />. Attack-resistance also is an important property but we don't analyze it here.

Recently there have been many proposals of trust metrics but we note how what is still missing is a deep evaluation of different trust metrics on different realistic datasets. This is due mainly because it is hard to get real world data and so most of the proposed trust metrics are simply not evaluated and surely never compared.

Our contribution with this paper tries to fill this important gap for the research community.
We in fact compare different trust metrics on some real world datasets.

{{todo|write one paragraph for explaining each trust metric}}
One of the most trivial trust metrics is simple unpersonalized average which is used by [[Ebay]], t(a, b) = Sigma(in_trust_b), simple example.

* advogato trust metric 
** The '''[[Advogato]] trust metric''' is one of the first proposed trust metric. It was created by [[wikipedia:Raph Levien|Raph Levien]]. The goal is to be attack-resistant. 
It is described [http://advogato.org/trust-metric.html here]. From levien paper: ''The underlying trust metric is run once for each level. For a given level, edges below that level are discarded. For example, to compute the Journeyer level, the underlying trust metric is run on the subset of the trust graph consisting of Journeyer and Master edges. The final certification assigned to the node is the maximum level for which the node is accepted.''
* [[PageRank]] (adapted to handle weighted links)
{{todo|adapt pagerank to handle weighted links}}
{{todo|explain how we rescale the values returned by pagerank that are really skewed! and make it so that the rescaling is convincing to readers, otherwise just don't use pagerank.}}
* [[moletrust]] (the simple breadth-first one Paolo proposed)

** need for local trust metric? AdvogatoLocal? From Levien thesis: ''Trust “seed” is hard-wired. In practice, hard-wired seed hasn’t caused problems, but it is a concern. Providing user-configured alternate seeds is a possible extension, but the need for it hasn’t been strongly felt.''


* some trivial ones, for example the trust metric that predicts always "master" (everyone_master) or journeyer (called everyone_journeyer) or ...
* shall we use some other ones (see [[Category:Trust metrics]])? Probably not for this paper.

** (we can remove this from this paper) There is probably a lot of reciprocation in the network, so an effective metric might increase the trust score when trust statements are not balanced. That is, if I go around and I certify everyone in the network there is high probability they will certify me back so getting high indegree is easy. So an unbalanced certification is very informative and useful, i.e. I certify rms as guru but rms does not certify me because he does not know me ... need to think better about this but wanted to write it down here. --[[User:PaoloMassa|PaoloMassa]] 10:41, 11 September 2007 (PDT)

=== Trust metrics evaluation methodology ===


The technique used for the comparison of the trust metrics is [[leave-one-out]], a common technique in machine learning. 

The process is the following. One trust edge (let's say from node A to node B) is deleted from the graph and then the trust metric is used to predict the value of trust A should place in B, i.e. the missing edge. The real value and the predicted value are then compared to compute a measure of error on this single prediction step. It is also possible that a trust metric is not able to compute the trust value and this refers to the coverage of the trust metric.

This evaluation step is repeated for all the edges and a global measure of error is computed, for example by averaging all the single errors and the coverage or by doing more deep analysis by considering only edges that satisfy certain constraints, for example, only on edges into nodes with a lot of friends, only into journeyer node or only for "master" edges, etc. 

{{todo|analyze deeply the results to see what can be said}}

== Experimental results ==

: underline that the code and the datasets are available under meaningful license at trustlet.org!!!

<!-- Describe the result -->

First there will be an analysis of the social network of Advogato: how many Master edges, how many Apprentice, ..., it is power law? Which exponent? It is connected? and much more, see also for inspiration [[The structure and function of complex networks]]

===Dataset analysis===
The Advogato dataset that was analyzed is a directed, weighted graph with 7294 nodes and 52981 trust relations. 
The dataset is comprised of 1 large connected component, followed by components of size 7 and smaller. Since we can not say anything sensible about components of size 1 and 2 we decided to leave these out of our analysis.
70.5% nodes are in the largest component. The second largest component contains 7 nodes.

The mean degree is 7.26. <!-- scipy.average(([len(A.in_edges(n)) for n in A.nodes()]))
7.26364134905
-->  

The standard deviation of the number of incoming nodes is 20.91 and of the outgoing nodes is 21.75. <!--
In [16]: scipy.std(([len(A.in_edges(n)) for n in A.nodes()]))
Out[16]: 20.9153700248

In [17]: scipy.std(([len(A.out_edges(n)) for n in A.nodes()]))
Out[17]: 21.745234556
-->

The mean shortest path length is 3.75<!-- 3.74620616945 -->.

The average cluster coefficient is 0.116<!--
In [10]: cluster.average_clustering(A)
Out[10]: 0.11594019745822683
  For each node find the fraction of possible triangles that are triangles,
      c_i = triangles_i / (k_i*(k_i-1)/2)
      where k_i is the degree of node i.       
    
      A coefficient for the whole graph is the average C = avg(c_i)
-->.

About the values of trust on edges: what is the distribution? How many Master edges, Apprentice, Observer, Journeyer? '''COMPLETE THIS!'''

What is the number of users who received only one kind of trust values? For example, users who were judged only as "master" by everyone, or only as "apprentice", .... (These users are not at all controversial, all the community agree about them and so they are not hard to predict). The same question but limiting to users with 5 or more incoming trust edges. '''COMPLETE THIS!'''

We found that the Advogato trust network obeys the power law distribution ''(how to find exponent?)''. '''COMPLETE THIS!''' (what about the trust network only considering Master edges? Only Journeyer? ...) '''COMPLETE THIS!'''

The reciprocity is 0.33 (one third of the trust judgments are reciprocated). <!-- 0.33366678620637585-->
''Check! Because the number is quite small, no? I was expecting much more reciprocity meaning "if you say I'm cool, I say you are cool as well". Check! '''COMPLETE THIS!''' ''

Also it would be interesting to understand: how many of the reciprocated edges are reciprocated with the same value? I.e.: If I say you are Master, do you say I'm Master...

<nowiki>In [114]: map(lambda x: scipy.average([(A.trust_on_edge(e) - _trust_val(A, e[1], e[0]))   for e in A.edges_iter() if A.has_edge(e[1], e[0]) and A.trust_on_edge(e) == x]), [0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0])
Out[114]: [-0.284233261339, -0.128773841962, 0.0145418976198, 0.15511466117]
</nowiki>
This is about the difference between reciprocated values. But need to explain in English this concept and this number. '''COMPLETE THIS!'''


* Analyze cohesion in the social network, how many people certify each other? Density Degree of nodes (number of incoming links, how many users have 2 incoming links, how many 5, ... and is this a power law?) Components Cores ... --[[User:PaoloMassa|PaoloMassa]] 10:32, 11 September 2007 (PDT)

* Interesting will be also maybe to analyze the controversiality of users (a user is not controversial if all the other users express the same judgement about her (i.e. all of the judger think she is a Master), a user is controversial if other users express different judgements about her (4 think she is Master, 4 think she is Apprentice, 4 thinks she is Journeyer ...). see [[Trust metrics on controversial users: balancing between tyranny of the majority and echo chambers]]. We could even define a Controversiality index, both for the single user and for the community in its entirety. --[[User:PaoloMassa|PaoloMassa]] 10:28, 11 September 2007 (PDT)

* Triads and missing relationships.  --[[User:PaoloMassa|PaoloMassa]] 10:28, 11 September 2007 (PDT)

* Place a cool visualization of the network? It is not very informative but it is in general attractive --[[User:PaoloMassa|PaoloMassa]] 10:35, 11 September 2007 (PDT)

* Check if the hypothesis of [[Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do]] is confirmed, i.e. most people have fewer friends than their friends have.

=== Trust metrics evaluation ===

Then there will be a comparison of the different trust metrics on the dataset, also focusing on particular views (popular users, not very postitive edges, ...)

''Not yet available but we are working on it ;-)''

''Important point made by Kasper: advogato is a "discrete" trust metric... and all the others are continuous so advogato will almost always lead to bad results with the leave-one-out test.''

Be frank about the intention behind the creation of the tested trust metrics.
* Pagerank was created for producing a global ranking of pages in order to discover the good ones and the less interesting ones, not for predicting the value of an edge (moreover on the web edges don't have values).
* Advogato was created with the goal of being attack-resistant in the sense to not give a high certificate to the few users who are malicious. Note that the underlying assumption if that most users are in good faith and there are just few malicious nodes. For this reason it tends to "get in" with everyone that is reached by the trust propagation (max flow). In fact theorem 1 if advogato trust metric clearly speaks about bounds in the number of bad nodes that get certified as good: "the number of bad nodes chosen is equal to the total flow minus the number of good and confused nodes chosen".Just as PageRank, Advogato was not created for inferring the correct value of trust that might be there between user A and user B.
(It is important to mention these points, because the intention behind an algorithm are of course decisive in its design and performance in different situations).
