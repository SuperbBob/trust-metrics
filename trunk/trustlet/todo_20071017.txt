* check that the condition "edge_to_controversial_node" is not buggy
** run paolo_gen_table.py with a lot of parameters on that
** add the results to the wiki

* Advogato trust metric is essential for our paper.
** Understand advogato trust metric (based on Levien formulation)
** Understand if pymmetry does precisely the same
** Run Advogato trust metric on Advogato dataset (maybe even on a subset of the edges)
** Create tables for it

* Complete the description of the dataset in the paper with information about datasets included for instance in Newman's paper

* Check the evaluations table and define the thesis of the paper
** write down this on the paper "Section # 5.2 Trust metrics evaluation"

* Write the rest of the paper (but section 5.2)
