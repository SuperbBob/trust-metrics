Trust metric testbed
30 Mar 2002

This is a testbed implementation of attack-resistant trust metrics.
Two trust metrics are provided: Advogato's network flow based metric,
and the PageRank algorithm, an eigenvector-based metric.

Edit main.c to tweak parameters. Yes, I know they should be runtime
settable, but this is a testbed.

The input format is graph.dot as produced by mod_virgule. If you're
creating your own, each edge is of the form:

   from -> to [color="color"];

where color is set to one of "green", "blue", or "violet". The present
implementation ignores color.

While this implementation is released under the GPL, the intellectual
property of the underlying trust metric algorithms is likely to be
different. The ideas (not the code) behind the Advogato trust metric
are in the public domain. The PageRank algorithm is probably patented
by Google; I'm not sure. Please check with a competent lawyer before
using PageRank for any purpose other than research.

Attack resistant trust metrics are the topic of my thesis-in-progress.
